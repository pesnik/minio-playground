# MinIO Playground 🚀

**Self-hosted object storage experimentation and mastery**

A comprehensive hands-on laboratory for exploring MinIO's capabilities, from single-node deployments to distributed clusters. This repository contains experiments, configurations, and real-world scenarios to build deep expertise in self-hosted object storage.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Deployment Mastery**: Single-node, multi-node, and distributed cluster setups
- **High Availability**: Erasure coding, replication, and failover strategies
- **Performance Optimization**: Benchmarking, tuning, and scaling patterns
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication, encryption, and access policies
- **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, backup strategies, and disaster recovery
- **Cloud Integration**: Hybrid deployments and migration patterns

docker-compose up -d

# Access MinIO Console
open http://localhost:9001
# Default credentials: minioadmin/minioadmin
```

### Explore Distributed Setup

```bash
# Launch a 4-node distributed cluster
cd deployments/multi-node/4-node-cluster
docker-compose up -d

# Verify cluster health
docker exec minio1 mc admin info minio
```
